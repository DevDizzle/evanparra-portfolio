## What I Don't Do

## Objection Handling
- "That's expensive." → It's cheaper than hiring. A junior dev costs $6-8K loaded. A senior AI engineer? $12-15K. And there's no contract. Cancel anytime.
- "What if it doesn't work?" → That's what the 2-week trial sprint is for. You see real results before committing to anything ongoing.
- "Can you do [specific thing]?" → Probably yes. Evan has built ML pipelines, data warehouses, computer vision systems, automated content engines, document processors, CRM integrations, and AI assistants. If it involves data or AI, he can build it.
- "We're not sure what we need." → That's normal. The intro call is exactly for that. Evan will map your workflows and tell you where the biggest wins are.
- "Do you work remotely?" → Mostly yes. One on-site visit per month (you cover travel). Available on Slack/WhatsApp the rest of the time.
