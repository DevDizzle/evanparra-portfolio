# Insight Acceleration Landing Page

## Overview
This repository powers a single-page landing site for Evan Parra's AI + BI consulting practice. The page focuses on one clear conversion path: demonstrate the value of accelerating time to insight and invite visitors to schedule a 15-minute Insight Audit. ProfitScout.app is highlighted as the flagship case study.

## What's Included

- **About** section sharing credentials and approach.
- **Booking** section with a Google Calendar appointment placeholder.

## Customization
1. **Update Copy & Metrics**: Open `public/index.html` and edit the strings within the React components (Hero, CaseStudy, Services, About, Booking).
2. **Swap Visuals**:
   - Replace `/assets/evan-parra-headshot.jpg` if you have a new headshot.
   - Update the ProfitScout screenshot placeholder inside the `CaseStudy` component with an actual image or embed.
3. **Connect Google Booking**:
   - Generate a Google Calendar Appointment Schedule.
   - Replace the `bookingLink` constant with your live scheduling URL.
   - Paste the iframe or script provided by Google inside the commented placeholder within the `Booking` section to embed the scheduler inline.
