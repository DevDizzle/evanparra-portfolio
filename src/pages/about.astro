          <h2>The Short Version</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Evan Parra. I'm a fractional AI engineer based in South Florida. For $4,500 a month, I embed in your business and build the AI systems you need. Automations, integrations, data pipelines, AI tools for your team. Whatever moves the needle. No contract. Cancel anytime.
          </p>

          <h2>The Longer Version</h2>
          <p>
            I spent years building ML systems for large companies. Predictive models, data warehouses, computer vision systems, ETL pipelines. The kind of work that sounds impressive on a resume but lives in corporate infrastructure nobody sees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I built GammaRips. An entire AI-native financial intelligence business from scratch. Automated pipeline that scans 5,000+ stocks every night, generates analysis, and delivers reports. Zero manual intervention. $50/month infrastructure cost. That project taught me something: AI isn't just a tool. It's an operating model.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I take that same approach and install it in other businesses. Not as a consultant who delivers a PDF. Not as a freelancer who disappears after the project. As a fractional engineer who embeds with your team, learns your operations, and builds systems that get smarter every month.
          </p>

          <h2>Credentials</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>MS in Artificial Intelligence</strong>, Florida Atlantic University (3.73 GPA, 2025)</li>
            <li><strong>PhD Researcher</strong>, FAU Generative Intelligence Lab. Researching multi-agent systems under Dr. Fernando Koch. Focus: how AI agents behave when they work together at scale.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Certified Professional Machine Learning Engineer</strong></li>
            <li><strong>BA Economics</strong>, Florida International University</li>
