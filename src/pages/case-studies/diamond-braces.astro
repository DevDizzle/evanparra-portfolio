      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>When a healthcare company operates 40+ locations, small inefficiencies multiply fast. Each location handles scheduling independently. Patient communication is inconsistent. Operational data is siloed across offices with no centralized view.</p>
      <p>Staff at every location spend hours on administrative tasks that could be automated. That's thousands of hours per year across the organization that aren't being spent on patient care.</p>

      <h2>What I Build for Multi-Location Companies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Patient Communication:</strong> Automated, consistent messaging across all locations. Appointment reminders, follow-ups, and intake processes that work the same whether you're at the Manhattan office or the Brooklyn one.</li>
        <li><strong>Scheduling Optimization:</strong> AI that learns from scheduling patterns to reduce no-shows, optimize chair time, and balance load across locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Operational Dashboard:</strong> Centralized intelligence across all 40+ locations. Real-time visibility into performance, bottlenecks, and opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>Admin Automation:</strong> The repetitive paperwork, data entry, and reporting that eats staff time gets handled by AI so the team can focus on patients.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Multi-Location Businesses Need This</h2>
      <p>When you're running one location, inefficiencies are annoying. When you're running 40, they're expensive. A 30-minute daily inefficiency at one office is 1,000+ hours per year across the organization.</p>
      <p>This kind of system scales with the business. Add a new location, the automation is already there. The processes are consistent. The data flows in. No retraining. No new hires for admin.</p>
