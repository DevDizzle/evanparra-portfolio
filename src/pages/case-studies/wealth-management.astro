      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Wealth management firms bleed hours on manual operations. Advisors log into 10+ fund admin portals daily to check for updates. K-1 documents get processed by hand across dozens of portals. Salesforce data entry consumes hours that should be spent with clients.</p>
      <p>Most firms have a small tech team but no AI expertise. They know automation could help but don't know where to start.</p>

      <h2>What I Designed</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>K-1 Document Automation:</strong> AI reads, extracts, and processes K-1 documents from multiple fund admin portals. What used to take hours per document now takes seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Portal Scraping:</strong> Automated scrapers log into fund admin portals, check for new documents and updates, and flag what needs attention. Advisors stop wasting time on manual portal checks.</li>
        <li><strong>Salesforce Integration:</strong> Data flows automatically from documents and portals into Salesforce. No more manual data entry. No more stale records.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Assistant for Advisors:</strong> Every advisor gets an AI assistant they can ask questions in plain English. "What's our policy on alternative investments for accounts over $5M?" The system knows the compliance handbook, investment policy statements, and custodian rules. Answers accurately with citations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>By month 3, every advisor has an AI assistant that knows the firm's compliance handbook, client policies, and fund structures. They ask a question, they get an accurate answer. No more hunting through SharePoint. No more calling compliance and waiting for a callback.</p>
      <p>The system compounds. Every document processed adds to its knowledge. Every question answered improves future responses. Month 1 it knows the basics. Month 6 it knows more about the firm's operations than any single employee.</p>
